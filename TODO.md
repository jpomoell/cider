Planned future work
----------------------------

CIDER is currently early-level software, with several improvements planned to be implemented.
These include (in potential approximate order of implementation):

  * Non-uniform radial coordinate in PFSS and MFW models
  * Support for high-resolution extrapolations by adding computations on patches
  * Use SunPy facilities throughout, in particular coordinates and units
  * Rewrite magnetogram loaders so as not to alter metadata directly
  * Parallel/multithreaded field line tracing
  * Documentation and more notebook examples
  * Migrate to a newer FISHPACK version, or a complete rewrite
  * Easier installation (using meson)
